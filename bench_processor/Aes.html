      <p class="text-md">
      ‚úÖ Optimized for Speed & Security
AES is a symmetric encryption algorithm that is extremely fast on modern processors due to hardware acceleration. <br>

‚úÖ CPU Performance

AES benefits from hardware support in most modern CPUs, such as AES-NI (Intel, AMD) and ARM Crypto Extensions.
AES-128 is generally faster than AES-256 because it has fewer rounds of encryption. <br>
‚úÖ GPU & ASIC Performance

AES is not as efficient on GPUs because of its memory-bound nature.
ASICs/FPGAs can optimize AES performance for applications like disk encryption, VPNs, and cloud security. <br>
‚ö†Ô∏è Downside:

Without AES-NI hardware support, AES performance drops significantly on some processors.
