    <h2>  üîπ ChaCha20</h2>
    <p>
      
        ‚úÖ Designed for Speed & Portability
        ChaCha20 is a stream cipher that provides fast encryption without requiring hardware acceleration.
        
        ‚úÖ CPU Performance
        
        Unlike AES, ChaCha20 does not rely on dedicated instructions (like AES-NI), making it ideal for low-end CPUs and embedded devices.
        Performs better on processors that lack AES hardware support (e.g., older or mobile CPUs).
        ‚úÖ Mobile & Embedded Devices
        
        Used in TLS encryption (e.g., Google‚Äôs adoption for Android & Chrome) because of its efficiency in software-only implementations.
        ‚ö†Ô∏è Downside:
        
        AES is still faster on CPUs with AES-NI acceleration.
        ChaCha20 is not as optimized for hardware acceleration as AES.
