     <h2>üîπ ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography)</h2>
    <p>
      ‚úÖ Stronger Security with Smaller Keys
ECC provides the same level of security as RSA but with much smaller keys, making it more efficient.

‚úÖ CPU Performance

ECC is much faster than RSA for key generation and cryptographic operations.
Used in SSL/TLS, cryptocurrencies, and secure messaging apps.
‚úÖ GPU & ASIC Performance

ECC is hardware-friendly and performs well on dedicated cryptographic processors.
Used in Bitcoin and blockchain for efficient digital signatures.
‚ö†Ô∏è Downside:

More complex implementation compared to RSA.
Not all systems support ECC acceleration yet.
