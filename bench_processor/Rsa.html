    <h2>üîπ RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman)</h2>
    <p>
        ‚úÖ Best for Key Exchange & Digital Signatures
RSA is an asymmetric encryption algorithm that is computationally expensive due to its reliance on large integer factorization.

‚úÖ CPU Performance

RSA operations (key generation, encryption, decryption) are significantly slower compared to symmetric encryption methods like AES.
Encryption (public key) is relatively faster than decryption (private key).
Performance decreases significantly as key size increases (e.g., RSA-2048 vs. RSA-4096).
‚úÖ Hardware Acceleration

RSA is not well-suited for GPUs due to its sequential nature.
Specialized hardware (e.g., TPMs, HSMs) can speed up RSA operations, but general CPUs struggle with its computational load.
‚ö†Ô∏è Downside:

Slow for large data encryption ‚Üí Better suited for encrypting small amounts of data (e.g., keys).
