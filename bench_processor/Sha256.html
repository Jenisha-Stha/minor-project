        üîπ SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit)
‚úÖ Optimized for Traditional Processors
SHA-256 is widely used and highly optimized for modern CPUs, thanks to hardware acceleration available in many processors (e.g., Intel‚Äôs SHA Extensions, ARM Cryptography Extensions).

‚úÖ Faster on Conventional CPUs
Because of its widespread usage, SHA-256 benefits from extensive software optimizations. On standard processors, it often outperforms SHA-3 in raw hashing speed.

‚úÖ Performance on GPUs & ASICs

GPUs: Performs well but not as parallelizable as some other hashing algorithms.
ASICs: Extremely optimized for mining applications (e.g., Bitcoin mining).
‚ö†Ô∏è Downside: SHA-256 follows the Merkle-Damg√•rd construction, which is more vulnerable to certain theoretical attack vectors compared to SHA-3‚Äôs sponge construction.
