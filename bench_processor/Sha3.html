    <h2>üîπ SHA-3 (Keccak Algorithm - 256-bit Variant)</h2>
    <p>
        ‚úÖ Designed for Hardware Parallelism
Unlike SHA-256, SHA-3 (Keccak) is built using a sponge construction, which allows parallel processing and is highly efficient on hardware accelerators.

‚úÖ Better Performance on FPGAs & ASICs
SHA-3's architecture is particularly efficient for hardware implementations, making it faster than SHA-256 when deployed on specialized chips like FPGAs and ASICs.

‚úÖ Security Overhead & Flexibility
SHA-3 is designed to be more resistant to cryptographic attacks, but this also means higher computational cost on traditional CPUs compared to SHA-256.

‚ö†Ô∏è Slower on General-Purpose CPUs
SHA-3 doesn‚Äôt yet have the same level of processor-specific optimizations as SHA-256, making it slightly slower on standard CPUs.
